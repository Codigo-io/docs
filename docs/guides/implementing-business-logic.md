# Implementing Business Logic

After defining your smart contract interfaces, the next step is implementing the business logic and integrating the
client libraries. This document will take you through this process.

:::tip
As good security best practices and owner of the implemented business logic, you, the developer, should always validate
and sanitize the input sent from the client. As the implementer of the business logic, you are the only one who can
determine what is valid or invalid data for your business. Please review
our [Terms of Service](https://codigo.ai/documents/Codigo---Terms-of-Service.pdf) for more information.
:::

For this doc, we will use the budget tracker example; you can clone it
from [here](https://github.com/Codigo-io/platform/tree/develop/examples/solana_native/budget_tracker). The budget
tracker CIDL will generate the following stub
files.

|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

After C√≥digo AI Generator completes its job, you will find a directory named `src` within the generated directories and
files. We will implement the business logic in these stubs files. Each method defined in the CIDL will have a file with
the same name as the method inside the stubs directory.

Whenever we open one of the stub files, we see a function corresponding to the same name as the file; thus, the same
name as the method defined in the CIDL. For example, if we open the `create_user_record.rs`, we will see the following
code:

```rust showLineNumbers
use solana_program::account_info::AccountInfo;
  use solana_program::entrypoint::ProgramResult;
  use solana_program::pubkey::Pubkey;

  use crate::generated::state::{
  AccountPDA,
  Record,
};


/// To call once per account. Initialize a Record account. The total_balance of the account will be set to 0.
///
/// Accounts:
/// 0. `[writable, signer]` fee_payer: [AccountInfo]
/// 1. `[writable]` user_record: [Record]
/// 2. `[]` system_program: [AccountInfo] Auto-generated, for account initialization
///
/// Data:
/// - user_name: [String] The username to be assigned to the Record.name property
/// - user_record_seed_index: [u8] Auto-generated, from input user_record of type [Record] set the seed named index, required by the type
pub fn create_user_record(
  program_id: &Pubkey,
  user_record: &mut AccountPDA<Record>,
  user_name: String,
) -> ProgramResult {
  // Implement your business logic here...

  Ok(())
}
```

When we specify the method‚Äôs summary and the inputs‚Äô description, C√≥digo AI Generator will render documentation comments
into the source code, allowing developers to understand the source code and build the documentation using the
command `cargo doc` for Rust-based blockchains.

If the method definition in the CIDLs includes inputs, these will also be rendered into the stub function. It is
important to note that you will receive the data structure wrap for complex blockchain data structures like Solana
Accounts. The wrapper's purpose is to add the data itself of the data structure, the data used to build it, and any
additional metadata information that comes with it.

Finally, you will be implementing the business logic inside the stub functions. From here on, you can create your
business models and use these business models within the stub functions.

## Next steps

Congratulations! üéâüëè at this point, you should have a basic understanding of implementing business logic.
To summarize what we learned:

- Each method defined in the CIDL will have a file with the same name as the method inside the `src` directory.
- It is recommended to specify a summary and description to generate documentation.
- Complex blockchain data structure will be wrapped for better accessibility.
