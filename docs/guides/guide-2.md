# Building Solana Programs with CIDL: A Comprehensive Guide Part II  

In the first part of this guide, we learned some basic Solana concepts, described what we are building, and how to define Solana Accounts in the CIDL. If you need a refresher on those concepts or don‚Äôt know what a Solana instruction, transaction, or signer is, please check the first part [Building Solana Program with CIDL: A Comprehensive Guide - Part I](#).

This second part will focus on defining the program methods. We add behavior to our program through methods. Methods will be transpile to Solana‚Äôs instructions. We can define an instruction within the `methods` array of objects.

## Our first method

The first method we define is `create_user_account`; this method will be used to initialize the User account. 
```
methods:
  - name: create_user_account
    summary: Method used to initialize the User account.
    inputs:
      - name: user
        type: User
        solana:
          attributes: [mut, init]
      - name: display_name
        type: string
```

**Congratulations** on writing your first method!

### Method‚Äôs structure
The methods object is composed of the required `name` property, a list of `inputs`, and the recommended property `summary`. Besides those properties, we can define different extensions. To learn more about the method‚Äôs structure, read [Learning the Basic - Methods](linktobedded).

In the first input named `user`, we can see a solana extension. If we remember the definition of extension from the last doc: An extension in the CIDL is an object composed of multiple properties that can target a specific blockchain, framework, or programming language. Through the solana extension, we define the attributes `mut` and `init`. These attributes will make the `User` account writable and generate all the code to create the account. To learn more about the solana extension within inputs, read [Solana Extension - Methods - Inputs](#).

:::info
Before using an Account, we need to create it within the blockchain. The `init` attribute generates all the code that tells the blockchain to create the account. To learn more about the solana `init` behavior, read [Solana Extension - Methods - Inputs](#).
:::

:::note
The specified attributes for the input-named `user` will only apply to the method `create_user_account`
:::

From the previous knowledge, we now can build the sentence on how to read the above code: 

> Defines a method named create user record composed of 2 inputs; the first is the user of type User, and the other display name of type string.

### Security: Verify signers
As mentioned in Part I of this guide, transactions require one or more signers. The above instruction, `create_user_account`, can only be used within a transaction. C√≥digo generators will add the minimum signer, commonly known as ‚Äúfee payer‚Äù, but also it will add the User account as a signer because we specify the `init` attribute.

From the above information, C√≥digo will generate the verified signers check. This check will verify that the expected accounts are signers. Malicious individuals can apply various vector attacks to hack your accounts without this check. 

## Challenge - Define the method to create Posts account

We encourage you to do the following challenge using the repository you cloned from Part I: 

> Define the method named `create_posts_account`. With the following inputs: 
- post of type `Posts`, attributes`mut` and `init` 
- title of type `string`
- short_description of type `string`
- feature_image_url of type `rs:option<string>`
- content_url of type `string`
- category of type `string`
- author of type `sol:pubkey`

If you get stuck, check [Our first method](#) to gain insight into completing the challenge.

```
methods:
  - name: create_posts_account
    summary: Method used to initialize a Posts account.
    inputs:
      - name: post
        type: Posts
        solana:
          attributes: [mut, init]
      - name: title
        type: string
      - name: short_description
        type: string
      - name: feature_image_url
        type: rs:option[string]
      - name: content_url
        type: string
      - name: category
        type: string
      - name: author
        type: sol:pubkey
```
</details>

## Linking inputs to account‚Äôs seeds
Congratulations on completing the previous challenge! 

Now let's learn how we can link inputs to seeds. If we remember the structure of `Posts`, `Posts` will be transpile to a PDA Account because of the seed definition:


```
types:
  Posts:
    solana:
      seeds:
        - name: post
        - name: user
          type: sol:pubkey
        - name: index
          type: u16
```

`Posts` defines a static seed with the value of `post` and two dynamic seeds. These two dynamics seeds must be sent when creating the account. C√≥digo generators will automatically add the required seeds inputs to the client libraries. But we want to guarantee that the value for the seed-named `user` is a public key belonging to a User account; how can we do this?

First, we add a new input of type User to the input list of the method `create_posts_account`:

```
methods:
  - name: create_posts_account
    inputs:
      # We added the input of type User before the Posts type
      - name: author
        type: User
      - name: post
        type: Posts
        solana:
          attributes: [mut, init]
```

Secondary, we link the input named author to the Posts‚Äô owner seed, we do this by defining the `seeds` property in the solana extension for the `post` input:

```
methods:
 - name: create_posts_account
    inputs:
      - name: author
        type: User
      - name: post
        type: Posts
        solana:
          attributes: [mut, init]
	   # Link the author input to the seed-named user
          seeds:
            user: author
```
To learn more about seeds linking, read [Solana Extension - Methods - Inputs](#).

## Challenge - Define the method to create Comment account

We encourage you to do the following challenge using the repository you cloned from Part I: 

> Define the method named `create_comment_account`. With the following inputs
- comment of type `Comments`, attributes `mut` and `init` and seeds user and post linked to there corresponding input
- user of type `User`
- post of type `Post`
- content of type `string`

If you get stuck, check [Our first method](#) to gain insight into completing the challenge.

methods: 
  - name: create_comment_account
    inputs:
      - name: comment
        type: Comments
        solana:
          attributes: [mut, init]
          seeds:
            user: user
            post: post
      - name: user
        type: User
      - name: post
        type: Posts
      - name: content

```

## Next steps

**Congratulations!** üéâüëè at this point, you should have a basic understanding of defining methods and linking inputs to the PDA Account‚Äôs seeds. To summarize what we learned:

- Through methods, we define the instruction of the smart contract.
- C√≥digo AI Generators add the verified signers' security check to each method.
- To make an account writable, specify the attribute `mut`.
- Specifying the `init` attribute generates all the code to initialize an account.
- We can link inputs to PDA Account‚Äôs seeds.
