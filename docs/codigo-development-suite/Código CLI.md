# Código's CLI

Through Código CLI, developers can interact with Código AI Generator. For the private beta, developers can only access the Código CLI from **[Código Studio](https://studio.codigo.ai)**. The Código CLI is configured to the PATH of the web-based environment; thus, you can access it from the terminal by going to Terminal -> New Terminal and typing the command `codigo`.

## Commands

### generate
Executes the Código AI Generator. For the private beta, it will generate the TypScript client library and the native Solana smart contract.

:::caution
For the moment, the generate command will overwrite the stub files. Make sure to save any information before rerunning it.

### Usage

```
