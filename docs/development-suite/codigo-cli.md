# CÃ³digo's CLI

Through CÃ³digo CLI, developers can interact with CÃ³digo Generator. Developers can access
the CÃ³digo CLI from [CÃ³digo Studio](https://studio.codigo.ai) or by downloading it
from [here](https://github.com/Codigo-io/platform/releases).

When using from CÃ³digo Studio, the CÃ³digo CLI is configured to the PATH of the
web-based environment; thus, you can access it from the terminal by going to Terminal -> New Terminal and typing the
command `codigo`.

:::tip
