# Solana

:::tip
If you haven‚Äôt read [Learning the Basic](../../learning-the-basics.md), we recommend you look at that first.

We can expand the capabilities of native, extended, or custom data types and instructions through extensions. An
extension in the CIDL is an object composed of multiple properties that can target a specific blockchain, framework, or
programming language. An extension can be defined in various places of the CIDL.

This document will show the different areas and properties available for the `solana` extension.

## Imports

For imports, we must define the solana extension when targeting the Solana blockchain.

```yaml showLineNumbers
imports:
  - ref: another_cidl
    loc: ./another_cidl.yaml
    solana:
      progid: 8WtjCDLNXNKCDzQHro6vsQT3PTUX4TuLuTbFomMSoMrs  
```

- `progid`:  Program ID of the deployed program. Accounts whose owner is set to `self` in the imported CIDL will take
  this `progid` as the owner‚Äôs value.

:::caution
Currently, `loc` only supports file system.
:::

## Types

We can define the `solana` extension to our custom types. The valid properties for the `solana` extension in the context
of the `types` are `owner`, `seeds` and `compress`. In the CIDL, it can look like this:

```yaml showLineNumbers
types:
  CustomDataStructure:
    # ...
    solana:
      owner: self | Pubkey
      compress: false | true
      seeds:
        - name: Static Value | Name of the seed
          type: Type of seed for non-static value
    # ...
```

- `owner`: Solana account‚Äôs owner. To learn more about this property, check
  [Solana Extension - Data Types - Types owner](./data-types.md#ownership)
- `seeds`: Solana PDA account‚Äôs seed definition. To learn more about this property, check
  [Solana Extension - Data Types - Types' seeds](./data-types.md#seeds)
- `compress`: Indicates the generator if this type will be used for state compression. To learn more about this
  property, check [Solana Extension - Data Types - Types](./data-types.md#compress)

## Fields

Some native and extended data type requires further configuration; therefore, we can define the `solana` extension to
any field object. The valid properties for the `solana` extension in the context of `fields` are `attributes`. In the
CIDL, it can look like this:

```yaml showLineNumbers
types:
  CustomDataStructure:
    # ...
    fields:
      - name: my_field
        type: string
        solana:
          attributes: [ cap:26 ]
```

- `attributes`: Through the attributes property, we can define the capacity of the data type. To learn more about this
  property, check [Solana Extension - Data Types](./data-types.md)

## Methods

In some cases, we need to specify additional configurations to our solana methods; this can be done through the `solana`
extension. In the context of the methods, the `solana` extension defines the properties `signers` and `default-payer`.
In the CIDL, it can
look like this:

```yaml showLineNumbers
methods:
  - name: my_instruction
    solana:
      default-payer: [ Optional ] false | true
      signers:
          - name: Name of the signer
            type: [ Optional ] Account type
            address: [ Optional ] Static Pubkey
            executable: [ Optional ] Validate if the account is a program
    # ...
```

- `default-payer`: By default, it is set to true. Set to false with an empty signer list to remove all signers from the
  method
- `signers`: We can define one or more signers to our solana instructions through the `signers` property. To learn more
  about this property, check [Solana Extension - Methods' signers](./methods.md#signers)

## Inputs

The last place where we can define the `solana` extension is in the `inputs`. Here, we have numerous
properties. In the CIDL, it looks like this:

```yaml showLineNumbers
methods:
  - name: my_instruction
    solana:
      - name: fee_payer
      - name: my_rent_payer
    inputs:
      - name: my_first_input
        type: CustomDataStructure
        solana:
          seeds:
            - seed_name: my_second_input
          attributes: [ init ]
          rent-payer: my_rent_payer
      - name: my_second_input
        type: string
      - name: account_info
        type: sol:account_info
        solana:
          attributes: [ init ]
          owner: 8WtjCDLNXNKCDzQHro6vsQT3PTUX4TuLuTbFomMSoMrs
      - name: system_program
        type: sol:account_info
        solana:
          address: 11111111111111111111111111111111
      - name: account_to_close
        type: CustomDataStructure
        solana:
          attributes: [ close ]
          rent-receiver: fee_payer
```

- `seeds`: The `seeds` in the context of inputs, tells the generator how to build match the seeds with the inputs or
  signers. To learn more about
  this property, check [Solana Extension - Methods - Inputs' seeds](./methods.md#seeds)
- `attributes`:  With the `attribute` property in the input context, we can specify different values depending on the
  type. To learn more about this property,
  check [Solana Extension - Methods - Inputs' attributes](./methods.md#attributes)
- `rent-payer`:  Through the `rent-payer` property, we can specify from which signer we which to pay the rent of an
  account. Defaults to the fee payer. To learn more about this property,
  check [Solana Extension - Methods - Inputs' rent-payer](./methods.md#rent-payer)
- `rent-receiver`: Through the `rent-receiver` property, we can specify which account will receive the lamports held by
  an account that will close. Defaults to the fee payer. To learn more about this property,
  check [Solana Extension - Methods - Inputs' rent-receiver](./methods.md#rent-receiver)
- `owner`: When working with a `sol:account_info` type, we can specify the owner of this account. This will generate the
  ownership security check for the given account.
- `address`: When working with a `sol:account_info` type, we can specify the address of this account. This will generate
  the address security check for the given account, ensuring the received account matches the address.

## Next Steps

**Congratulations!** üéâüëè at this point, you should have a basic understanding of the sections where we can define
the `solana` extension. To summarize what we learned:

- We can define the `solana` extension in the context of `types`, `fields`, `methods`, and `inputs`.
- The `solana` extension for `types` comprises the properties `owner`, `seeds`, and `compress`.
- The `solana` extension for `fields` comprises the property `attributes`.
- The `solana` extension for `methods` comprises the property `signers` and `default-payer`.
- The `solana` extension for `inputs` comprises the properties `seeds`, `rent-payer`, `rent-receiver`, `owner`, `address` and `attributes`.
